Following the 7.8 Mw Gorkha Earthquake on April 25, 2015, Nepal carried out a
massive household survey using mobile technology to assess building damage in
the earthquake-affected districts.

<li>Building a model is probably not the end goal.</li>
<li>How does the business expect to use and benefit from this model?</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>
<p>
Knowing the objective is important because it
will determine how you frame the problem, which algorithms you will select,
which performance measure you will use to evaluate your model, and how much
effort you will spend tweaking it.
</p>

  Although the primary goal of this survey was
to identify beneficiaries eligible for government assistance for housing
reconstruction, it also collected other useful socio-economic information. In
addition to housing reconstruction, this data serves a wide range of uses and
users e.g. researchers, newly formed local governments, and citizens at large.
The purpose of this portal is to open this data to the public.

What are the current solutions?
</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Understanding what the current solution looks like (if there is one) is
critical, as it gives you a reference performance.
Some early stage physics models, as well as widely held beliefs about how to
earthquake proof buildings, but this model can potentially go further- looking
at regional distribution, building usage etc.

How should we frame this solution?
</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
how should we frame this problem? supervised/unsupervised/reinforcement
learning? classification/regression or something else?
</p>

<p>
We are predicting the level of damage from 1 to 3. The level of damage is an
ordinal variable meaning that ordering is important.
</p>

<p>
This can be viewed as a
classification or an ordinal regression problem. (Ordinal regression is
sometimes described as an problem somewhere in between classification and
regression.)

Driven data, in order to have a leaderboard, sets a specific performance
measure.
In this case, it uses micro-averaged f1 score.

<p>
To measure the performance of our algorithms, we&rsquo;ll use the F1 score which
 balances the precision and recall of a classifier. Traditionally, the F1 score
 is used to evaluate performance on a binary classifier, but since we have three
 possible labels we will use a variant called the micro averaged F1 score.

 is used to evaluate performance on a binary classifier, but since we have three
 possible labels we will use a variant called the micro averaged F1 score.
 When you have a small positive class, then F1 score makes more sense than
roc-auc, which generally gives a good indicator of performance.

<li>In Micro-average method, you sum up the individual true positives, false positives, and false negatives of the system for different sets and then apply them to get the statistics.</li>
<li>In Macro-average, you take the average of the precision and recall of the system on different sets</li>

</ul>
<p>
Micro-average is preferable if there is a class imbalance problem.

In typical environments your data would be available in a relational database
(or some other common data store) and spread across multiple
tables/documents/files. To access it, you would first need to get your
credentials and access authorizations10 and familiarize yourself with the data
schema. In this project, however, things are much simpler.
This survey is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected,
containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and
socio-economic-demographic statistics.
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note: automate as much as possible so you can easily get fresh data.
List the data you need and how much you need.
Find and document where you can get that data.
Check how much space it will take.
Check legal obligations, and get authorization if necessary.
Get access authorizations.
Create a workspace (with enough storage space).
Get the data.
Convert the data to a format you can easily manipulate (without changing the data itself).
Ensure sensitive information is deleted or protected (e.g., anonymized).
Check the size and type of data (time series, sample, geographical, etc.).
Sample a test set, put it aside, and never look at it (no data snooping!).

<ul><li>Discovery and visualisation</li><li>Prepare your data for ML</li><li>Select a model</li><li>Fine-tune your model</li><li>Present your solution</li><li>Launch, monitor and maintain your system</li></ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Work on copies of the data (keep the original dataset intact).
</p>

<ol>
<li>Discovery
<ul>
<li>Get insights from a field expert for exploratory analysis</li>
<li>Study each attribute and its characteristics:
<ul>
<li>Type (categorical, int/float, bounded/unbounded, text, structured, etc.)</li>
<li>% of missing value</li>
<li>Noisiness and type of noise (stochastic, outliers, rounding errors, etc.)</li>
<li>Type of distribution (Gaussian, uniform, logarithmic, etc.)</li>
<li>Study the correlations between attributes.</li>
<li>Identify extra data that would be useful</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Prepare your data</li>

</ol>
<p>
Write functions for all data transformations you apply, for five reasons:
</p>

<ul>
<li>So you can easily prepare the data the next time you get a fresh dataset</li>
<li>So you can apply these transformations in future projects</li>
<li>To clean and prepare the test set</li>
<li>To clean and prepare new data instances once your solution is live</li>
<li>To make it easy to treat your preparation choices as hyperparameters</li>

</ul>

<p>
DATA CLEANING:
Fix or remove outliers (optional).
Fill in missing values (e.g., with zero, mean, median…) or drop their rows (or columns).
</p>

<p>
FEATURE SELECTION (OPTIONAL):
Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the task.
</p>

<p>
FEATURE ENGINEERING, WHERE APPROPRIATE:
Discretize continuous features.
Decompose features (e.g., categorical, date/time, etc.).
Add promising transformations of features (e.g., log(x), sqrt(x), x2, etc.).
Aggregate features into promising new features.
</p>

<p>
FEATURE SCALING
Standardize or normalize features.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Select a model</li>

</ol>

<p>
If the data is huge, you may want to sample smaller training sets so you can
train many different models in a reasonable time (be aware that this penalizes
complex models such as large neural nets or Random Forests).
</p>

<p>
Once again, try to automate these steps as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
Train many quick-and-dirty models from different categories (e.g., linear, naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, neural net, etc.) using standard parameters.
</p>

<p>
Measure and compare their performance.
For each model, use N-fold cross-validation and compute the mean and standard deviation of the performance measure on the N folds.
</p>

<p>
Analyze the most significant variables for each algorithm.
</p>

<p>
Analyze the types of errors the models make.
What data would a human have used to avoid these errors?
</p>

<p>
Perform a quick round of feature selection and engineering.
</p>

<p>
Perform one or two more quick iterations of the five previous steps.
</p>

<p>
Shortlist the top three to five most promising models, preferring models that
make different types of errors.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Fine-tune your model</li>

</ol>
<p>
You will want to use as much data as possible for this step, especially as you
move toward the end of fine-tuning.
</p>

<p>
As always, automate what you can.
</p>

<p>
Fine-tune the hyperparameters using cross-validation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Treat your data transformation choices as hyperparameters, especially when you
are not sure about them (e.g., if you’re not sure whether to replace missing
values with zeros or with the median value, or to just drop the rows).</li>
<li>Unless there are very few hyperparameter values to explore, prefer random
search over grid search. If training is very long, you may prefer a Bayesian
optimization approach (e.g., using Gaussian process priors, as described by
Jasper Snoek et al.)</li>

</ul>

<p>
Try Ensemble methods. Combining your best models will often produce better
performance than running them individually.
</p>

<p>
Once you are confident about your final model, measure its performance on the
test set to estimate the generalization error.
</p>

<p>
WARNING
Don’t tweak your model after measuring the generalization error: you would just
start overfitting the test set.
