#+BEGIN_NOTES
For the purposes of this exercise I am going to use California census data to
build a model to predict house prices

- What is it you are trying to achieve?
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  how does your business expect to use and benefit from this model?
  This is important because it will determine how you frame the roblem, what
  algorithms you select, what performance meausre you will use to evaluate your
  model, and how much effort you should spend tweaking it.
  in this example, the ansmer is that the model's output (a predictio of a
  district's median housing price) will be fed to another ML system which will
  determine whether it is worth inesting in a given area or not
  #+END_NOTES
- What are the current solutions?
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  understanding what the current solution looks like (if there is one) is
  critical, as it fives you a reference performance
   #+END_NOTES
- How should we frame this solution?
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  how should we frame this problem? supervised/unsupervised/reinforcement
  learning? classification/regression or something else?
  answer- this is a typical supervised learning taks since you are given albeled
  training examples. It is a typical regression task since you are asked to
  predict a value. More specifically this is a multiple regression probem since
  the model will use multiple freatures to make a prediction. It is also a
  univariate regression problem since we are only trying to predict a single
  value for each district

** What does good mean?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
How do we measure performance?
 \begin{equation}
 RMSE = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_{i})^2 }
 \end{equation}
